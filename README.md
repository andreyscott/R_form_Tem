## Create React App FormPlus__
Bulky data handling tasking and state management<br>


## How do I get setup ?
1. Clone Project and [cd] to project directory
2. Run `yarn install` in root folder to install dependencies
3. Type `yarn start` in the root folder to initialise project on local dev. env.
4. Navigate to your browser http://localhost:[your port in dev.env] e.g. http://localhost:3000

## The Challenge
React app to handle large amounts of data

## Expected Behaviour
- Project to be able to parse data from the provide api link to UI.
- Only one category on the templates can be active at a time.
- Template headers should bear their respective namme, when on filter on onsearch.
- “All templates” is active by default. Changing the category section resets all other filters and the Search bar value.
- Template category can either be "All", "Education", "E-commerce" or "Health".
- Users should also be able to search through each template category individually using only their template names.
- Users should be able to filter each template category based on - either not both (reset the other filter when one is active).
- The Alphabetical Order filter can either be "Default", "Ascending" or "Descending" order
- The Date created filter can either be "Default", "Ascending" or "Descending" order
- General design principle apllication.
